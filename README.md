# bpmass
Mass addition of BPM tags to .opus files metadata.

Uses `bpm-tools` and `opuscomment`

`./install.sh` builds all the shit.

After that start `exec /link/to/bpmass` in a folder with audio.

`bpm-tools`: http://www.pogo.org.uk/~mark/bpm-tools/

`opuscomment` (really great tool for opus metadata): https://github.com/hcmiya/opuscomment
